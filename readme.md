# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a browser version of a Tic-Tac-Toe minigame. I started this project to practice Module Pattern, Factory Functions, Objects and DOM manipulation, and in general, to improve my JavaScript Skills. It was built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.

## Functionality

- First we can see a menu, where we can choose if we want to play Player vs Player, or Player vs AI.
- If you select Player vs Player, two players will take turns marking X and O respectively on the board. The player who has 3 marks in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, will win.
- If you select Player vs AI, the player will face an AI that will mark O randomly on the board, after the player marks his respective X. The player who has 3 marks in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins.
- In both modes you will find the same 2 buttons below the board, one to reset the current board, and one to go back and change the game mode.

## Learning Outcome:

- I greatly improved my understanding of JavaScript, I faced a big challenge with the Go back button, because the easiest solution was to just reload the page, but I got pretty obstinate about it and really wanted everything to work without reloading the page, and finally I got it.
- I improved my CSS skills, I used Grid and Flexbox for this project, I always enjoy using CSS to be honest.
- The reusability of functions, and the handling of combined event listeners was one of the most necessary things to satisfactorily achieve the expected result.
- Although Iâ€™m not a UI designer, it was fun to design the project on my own and honestly, I really liked the end result. I used Figma for this purpose.
- I learned about design patterns, factory functions, and object creation and manipulation.
- I have also used various methods of arrays, even combined, such as every and includes.
- It was a very fun project to make, and I feel that my learning outcome for this project was important and valuable.
